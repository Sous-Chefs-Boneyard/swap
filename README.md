This cookbook provides an LWRP for easily creating and managing swap files.

**This cookbook requires Ruby 1.9 or higher!**

Usage
-----
Add a new swap:
```ruby
swap_file '/mnt/swap' do
  size      1024    # MBs
end
```
Add a new swap for aix:
```ruby
swap_file 'paging00' do
  size      1024    # MBs
  from_vg   testvg  # Must specify volume group for AIX
end
```
Or remove an existing one:
```ruby
swap_file '/mnt/swap' do
  action    :remove
end
```

Installation
------------
If you're using [berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf), add `swap` to your `Berksfile`:

```ruby
cookbook 'swap'
```

Otherwise, install the cookbook from the community site:

    knife cookbook site install swap

Have any other cookbooks depend on this cookbook by adding it to the `metadata.rb`:

```ruby
depends 'swap'
```

Now you can use the LWRP in your cookbook!

ChefSpec matchers
